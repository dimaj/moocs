In the past decade, machine learning has given us\n    self-driving cars, practical speech recognition, effective web search,\n    and a vastly improved understanding of the human genome. Machine learning\n    is so pervasive today that you probably use it dozens of times a day without\n    knowing it. Many researchers also think it is the best way to make progress\n    towards human-level AI. In this class, you will learn about the most effective\n    machine learning techniques, and gain practice implementing them and getting\n    them to work for yourself. More importantly, you''ll learn about not only\n    the theoretical underpinnings of learning, but also gain the practical\n    know-how needed to quickly and powerfully apply these techniques to new\n    problems. Finally, you''ll learn about some of Silicon Valley''s best practices\n    in innovation as it pertains to machine learning and AI.</p>\n<p>This course provides a broad introduction to machine learning, datamining,\n    and statistical pattern recognition. Topics include: (i) Supervised learning\n    (parametric/non-parametric algorithms, support vector machines, kernels,\n    neural networks). (ii) Unsupervised learning (clustering, dimensionality\n    reduction, recommender systems, deep learning). (iii) Best practices in\n    machine learning (bias/variance theory; innovation process in machine learning\n    and AI). The course will also draw from numerous case studies and applications,\n    so that you''ll also learn how to apply learning algorithms to building\n    smart robots (perception, control), text understanding (web search, anti-spam),\n    computer vision, medical informatics, audio, database mining, and other\n    areas.</p>', 'https://www.coursera.org/course/ml', 'http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0WKJLovaZg', '2013-04-22', 10, 'https://s3.amazonaws.com/coursera/topics/ml/large-icon.png', 'Statistics and Data Analysis, Computer Science: Artificial Intelligence', 'Coursera'),

Probability theory gives us the basic foundation to model our beliefs about the different possible states of the world, and to update these beliefs as new evidence is obtained. These beliefs can be combined with individual preferences to help guide our actions, and even in selecting which observations to make. While probability theory has existed since the 17th century, our ability to use it effectively on large problems involving many inter-related variables is fairly recent, and is due largely to the development of a framework known as Probabilistic Graphical Models (PGMs). This framework, which spans methods such as Bayesian networks and Markov random fields, uses ideas from discrete data structures in computer science to efficiently encode and manipulate probability distributions over high-dimensional spaces, often involving hundreds or even many thousands of variables. These methods have been used in an enormous range of application domains, which include: web search, medical and fault diagnosis, image understanding, reconstruction of biological networks, speech recognition, natural language processing, decoding of messages sent over a noisy communication channel, robot navigation, and many more. The PGM framework provides an essential tool for anyone who wants to learn how to reason coherently from limited and noisy observations.</p>\nIn this class, you will learn the basics of the PGM representation and how to construct them, using both human knowledge and machine learning techniques; you will also learn algorithms for using a PGM to reach conclusions about the world from limited and noisy evidence, and for making good decisions under uncertainty.

Evidence shows that people who think with models consistently outperform those who don''t. And, moreover people who think with lots of models outperform people who use only one.\nWhy do models make us better thinkers?\nModels help us to better organize information - to make sense of that fire hose or hairball of data (choose your metaphor) available on the Internet. Models improve our abilities to make accurate forecasts. They help us make better decisions and adopt more effective strategies. They even can improve our ability to design institutions and procedures. In this class, I present a starter kit of models: I start with models of tipping points. I move on to cover models explain the wisdom of crowds, models that show why some countries are rich and some are poor, and models that help unpack the strategic decisions of firm and politicians. The models covered in this class provide a foundation for future social science classes, whether they be in economics, political science, business, or sociology.

Rather, the course will emphasize those aspects of the theory that people really use in practice. Finite automata, regular expressions, and context-free grammars are ideas that have stood the test of time. They are essential tools for compilers. But more importantly, they are used in many systems that require input that is less general than a full programming language yet more complex than "push this button."<br><br>The concepts of undecidable problems and intractable problems serve a different purpose. Undecidable problems are those for which no computer solution can ever exist, while intractable problems are those for which there is strong evidence that, although they can be solved by a computer, they cannot be solved sufficiently fast that the solution is truly useful in practice. Understanding this theory, and in particular being able to prove that a problem you are facing belongs to one of these classes, allows you to justify taking another approach — simplifying the problem or writing code to approximate the solution, for example.<br><br>During the course, I''m going to prove a number of things. The purpose of these proofs is not to torture you or confuse you. Neither are the proofs there because I doubt you would believe me were I merely to state some well-known fact. Rather, understanding how these proofs, especially inductive proofs, work, lets you think more clearly about your own work. I do not advocate proofs that programs are correct, but whenever you attempt something a bit complex, it is good to have in mind the inductive proofs that would be needed to guarantee that what you are doing really works in all cases.', 'https://www.coursera.org/course/automata', 'http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tb_2HdsqypI', '0000-00-00', 6, 'https://s3.amazonaws.com/coursera/topics/automata/large-icon.png', 'Computer Science: Theory', 'Coursera'),

The course assumes no prior\nbackground in economics or law, and begins with an introduction to the basic\nconcepts of property, exchange, efficiency and externality. On this foundation,\nspecific topics in the law, including property, tort&nbsp;and crime, eminent domain, intellectual property and criminal procedure,&nbsp;are considered. Each group of lectures will\nelaborate on a different concrete problem or example to suggest the range of legal issues and questions&nbsp;to which economic reasoning can be productively applied. The ideas and\nmodes of analysis developed in the course are not difficult or mysterious, but\nthe questions of interpretation and policy that they raise about a subject&nbsp;that affects everyone&nbsp;are challenging and\nprovocative. <p></p>', 'https://www.coursera.org/course/lawandecon', 'http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UzJNfaoki2c', '2013-03-18', 6, 'https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/20/29a56e9044b4ed07a9abc3140b84bf/Smokestacks_3958.jpeg', 'Economics & Finance, Humanities, Law', 'Coursera'),
(548, 'Introduction to Music Production', 'Learn about the music production process—including recording, editing, and mixing—and the tools available to you to create contemporary music on your computer. ', 'With the recent introduction of high-quality-low-cost software and hardware, the tools of music production are now available to the masses. Albums are made in bedrooms as well as studios. On the surface this is liberating. Anyone can make an album for the low cost of a couple pieces of gear and a software package. But, if you dig deeper, you will find that it is not so easy. Producing music requires knowledge, <b></b>dedication, and creativity.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>Knowledge is where this course comes in. No matter what kind of music you are making, there is a large set of tools that you will need to use.&nbsp; Each lesson of this course will demonstrate a different set of music production tools, loosely following along the music production process of recording, editing, and mixing. <br><br>We will start with some background on the nature of sound and how we perceive it. We will then examine the components necessary to record audio into a computer, so that you understand the devices that sound must travel through in a music production process. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>Once recorded, sound must be organized along a timeline, a process known as editing. It allows us to give the impression of perfect performances and create many of the sounds we hear in contemporary music. The contemporary editing tool is the Digital Audio Workstation (DAW),&nbsp; a piece of software that stores and organizes all the assets of a musical project. We will focus on the editing tools that are essential in contemporary music production and that all DAWs provide. <br><br>After editing, sounds must be combined or mixed together, so we look to the mixing board—a very creative place if you know how to use it. We will explore the basic functionality of both hardware and software mixing boards, including volume, pan, mute, solo, busses, inserts, sends, and submixes. The mixing process, however, includes more tools than the mixing board provides on its own. Sound must also be processed, modified from its recorded state to fit the context of the music. We will look at compression, equalization, and delay, and examine the many audio effects that are offshoots of these devices and how they are used in a musical context.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>We will then explore the synthesizer, a major tool within the production of contemporary music. Yes, great music can and will be created without the synthesizer, but learning how a synthesizer works will give you a language to describe sound. Music is a collaborative art form, so there is nothing more powerful than effective communication. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>In the end, the music production process relies on your creativity. Creativity is a product of the mind and will stay there, unexpressed, until the right tools are used in the right way to share it with the world. If you have an idea in your head, it will take numerous steps, each with an important tool, to reach your audience. You bring the dedication and creativity, and this course will bring you the knowledge to make that happen.<br>', 'https://www.coursera.org/course/musicproduction', 'http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pgIQ7ouOw4M', '2013-03-01', 6, 'https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/01/ddf467a93b09155ddb4f07b07204b1/production-large.jpg', 'Music, Film, and Audio', 'Coursera'),

Absorbing, studying and understanding the role of technology\nfrom a critical viewpoint allows us to generate creative ideas for improving\nour cities.&nbsp;\n<br>\n<br>This course begins by examining how our cities are changing. We then jump\ninto how technology is used to engage with the public to support decision-making.\nStudents will be examining tools for analyzing the city. Then we move into\nexploring the infrastructure that makes the real-time, technologically-enhanced\ncity possible. And rounding out the course is an exploration of entrepreneurial\nurbanism, looking at how creativity can spawn technological innovation.\nYou''ll hear from technological innovators and thought leaders about all\nof these topics.

Moreover, the etiology of this heterogeneous disorder points to the key role of genetic and&nbsp;environmental interactions during prenatal and perinatal periods.

A phylogenetic tree will almost always help you think more clearly about your biological problem.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>A special emphasis is put on methods that employ explicit models of the evolutionary process (maximum likelihood and Bayesian approaches), and we will explore the role of statistical modeling in molecular evolution, and in science more generally. A mathematical (statistical) model of a biological system can be considered to be a stringently phrased hypothesis about that system, and this way of thinking about models will often be helpful. In addition to model-based methods, you will also learn about other approaches, such as those based on parsimony and genetic distance (<i>e.g.</i>, neighbor joining).&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Often, the evolutionary tree &nbsp;is the result we are interested in - knowing how a set of sequences (or organisms) are related can provide us with important information about the biological problem we are &nbsp;investigating. For instance, knowing which organisms are most closely related to a newly identified, uncharacterized, pathogenic bacterium will allow you to infer many aspects of its lifestyle, thereby giving you important clues about how to fight it. In other cases, however, inferring the structure of the tree is not the goal: for instance, our main focus may instead be the detection of positions in a protein undergoing positive selection (indicating adaptation) or negative selection (indicating conserved functional importance). However, even in these cases, the underlying phylogenetic tree <i>will</i> be an important part of our hypothesis about (model of) how the proteins have been evolving, and will help in getting the correct answer.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Although the study of molecular evolution does require a certain level of mathematical understanding, this course has been designed to be accessible also for students with limited computational background (e.g., students of biology).</div><div><br></div><div>Topics covered:<br><br></div><ul><li>Brief introduction to evolutionary theory and population genetics.</li><li>Mechanisms of molecular evolution.</li><li>Models of DNA and protein substitution.</li><li>Reconstruction of phylogenetic trees using parsimony, distance based methods, maximum likelihood, and Bayesian techniques.</li><li>Advanced models of nucleotide substitution (gamma-distributed mutation rates, molecular clock models, codon models and analysis of selective pressure).</li><li>Statistical analysis of biological hypotheses (likelihood ratio tests, non-parametric and parametric bootstrapping, Bayesian statistics).</li></ul><div><br></div>', 'https://www.coursera.org/course/molevol', 'http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCj2vAtYqho', '2013-06-24', 10, 'https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/c0/3c822f759b1d4d312426a1b8c219be/green_lime4.png', 'Biology & Life Sciences, Statistics and Data Analysis', 'Coursera'),

We offer everyone a flexible schedule and multiple paths for participation. You can work through the course videos and readings at your own pace to complete the associated exercises by the end date. Or, you may choose to "audit" the course by exploring just the particular videos and readings that seem most suited to your interests. You are free to do as much or as little as you would like. Either way, new participants will be joining the course through late June, so you would actually be quite early if you start now!\nWhat is it to be human, and how can ancient concepts of the heroic and anti-heroic inform our understanding of the human condition? That question is at the core of The Ancient Greek Hero, which introduces (or reintroduces) students to the great texts of classical Greek culture by focusing on concepts of the Hero in an engaging, highly comparative way.\nThe classical Greeks'' concepts of Heroes and the "heroic" were very different from the way we understand the term today. In this course, students analyze Greek heroes and anti-heroes in their own historical contexts, in order to gain an understanding of these concepts as they were originally understood while also learning how they can inform our understanding of the human condition in general.\nIn Greek tradition, a hero was a human, male or female, of the remote past, who was endowed with superhuman abilities by virtue of being descended from an immortal god. Rather than being paragons of virtue, as heroes are viewed in many modern cultures, ancient Greek heroes had all of the qualities and faults of their fellow humans, but on a much larger scale. Further, despite their mortality, heroes, like the gods, were objects of cult worship – a dimension which is also explored in depth in the course.\nThe original sources studied in this course include the Homeric Iliad and Odyssey; tragedies of Aeschylus, Sophocles, and Euripides; songs of Sappho and Pindar; dialogues of Plato; historical texts of Herodotus; and more, including the intriguing but rarely studied dialogue "On Heroes" by Philostratus. All works are presented in English translation, with attention to the subtleties of the original Greek. These original sources are frequently supplemented both by ancient art and by modern comparanda, including opera and cinema (from Jacques Offenbach''s opera Tales of Hoffman to Ridley Scott''s science fiction classic Blade Runner).\nThe true hero of the course is the logos ("word") of reasoned expression, as activated by Socratic dialogue. The logos of dialogue requires both careful thought and close (or "slow") reading, which is a core skill taught in this class. The course begins by considering the heroes of Homer''s epics and ends with Plato''s memories of the final days of Socrates -- memories which can only be fully understood by a reader who has gained a thorough comprehension of the ancient Greek hero in all his or her various manifestations.\nUsing modern technology and engaging texts, The Ancient Greek Hero provides students who have no previous background in classical Greek civilization with a fully engaging and immediately accessible introduction to the most beautiful moments in this ancient literature, its myths, and its ritual practices.\n', 'https://www.edx.org/courses/HarvardX/CB22x/2013_Spring/about', '', '0000-00-00', 0, 'http://www.edx.org/c4x/HarvardX/CB22x/asset/images_course_image.jpg', '', 'Edx'),

', 'CS188.1x is a new online adaptation of the first half of UC Berkeley''s CS188: Introduction to Artificial Intelligence. The on-campus version of this upper division computer science course draws about 600 Berkeley students each year.\nArtificial intelligence is already all around you, from web search to video games.  AI methods plan your driving directions, filter your spam, and focus your cameras on faces.  AI lets you guide your phone with your voice and read foreign newspapers in English.  Beyond today''s applications, AI is at the core of many new technologies that will shape our future.  From self-driving cars to household robots, advancements in AI help transform science fiction into real systems.\n               \n        CS188.1x focuses on Behavior from Computation.  It will introduce the basic ideas and techniques underlying the design of intelligent computer systems. A specific emphasis will be on the statistical and decision–theoretic modeling paradigm.  By the end of this course, you will have built autonomous agents that efficiently make decisions in stochastic and in adversarial settings.  CS188.2x (to follow CS188.1x, precise date to be determined) will cover Reasoning and Learning.  With this additional machinery your agents will be able to draw inferences in uncertain environments and optimize actions for arbitrary reward structures. Your machine learning algorithms will classify handwritten digits and photographs. The techniques you learn in CS188x apply to a wide variety of artificial intelligence problems and will serve as the foundation for further study in any application area you choose to pursue. \n      \n', 'https://www.edx.org/courses/BerkeleyX/CS188.1x/2012_Fall/about', '', '0000-00-00', 0, 'http://www.edx.org/static/content-berkeley-cs188x~2012_Fall/images/course_image.jpg', '', 'Edx'),
